            <h2 class="header2 text-left">Our Journey</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">BrieflyAI started from a simple frustration: spending hours reading articles and documentation just to extract a few key points. As students and developers ourselves, we knew there had to be a better way.
            What began as a personal project to save time quickly evolved into something bigger. We realized that everyone - from researchers buried in academic papers to professionals trying to stay updated in their field - faced the same challenge.
            Today, BrieflyAI uses cutting-edge AI to transform how people interact with online content. We're constantly improving our technology and listening to our users to build the most efficient summarization tool available.</p>
